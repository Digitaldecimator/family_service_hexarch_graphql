1. **Test Authentication**: Verify that only authenticated users can access the API.
2. **Test Authorization**: Verify that users can only access resources they are authorized to access.
3. **Test Input Validation**: Verify that input data is validated to prevent injection attacks.
4. **Test Error Handling**: Verify that errors are handled gracefully and do not reveal sensitive information.
5. **Test Data Protection**: Verify that sensitive data is protected.
6. **Test HTTPS**: Verify that the API is accessible only over HTTPS.
7. **Test JWT Security**: Verify that JWTs are secure and cannot be tampered with.
