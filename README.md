## Introduction

In today‚Äôs digital world, managing family data efficiently is crucial. This repository provides a foundational framework to build upon. It allows developers to create a GraphQL service that is not only powerful but also easy to extend and maintain. 

## Features

- **GraphQL API**: Easily query and manipulate family data.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to manage.
- **Database Support**: Choose between MongoDB and PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with Grafana and Prometheus for performance monitoring.
- **Extensible**: Add new features without affecting existing functionality.

## Architecture

The hexagonal architecture separates the application into different layers, making it easier to test and maintain. The core business logic remains isolated from external systems like databases and APIs. This structure enhances adaptability and promotes cleaner code.

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: The main programming language for the service.
- **GraphQL**: For building the API.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database option.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database option.
- **Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.
- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Family Service GraphQL project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Digitaldecimator/family_service_hexarch_graphql.git
   cd family_service_hexarch_graphql
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   Set up your environment variables for database connections. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify your database configurations.

   ```env
   DATABASE_TYPE=mongodb # or postgresql
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

4. **Run the Service**

   Start the service with the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. **Access the GraphQL Playground**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/graphql` to access the GraphQL playground.

## Usage

You can use the GraphQL API to perform various operations on family data. Here are some example queries:

### Query Example

```graphql
query {
  families {
    id
    name
    members {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutation Example

```graphql
mutation {
  addFamily(name: "Smith") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
